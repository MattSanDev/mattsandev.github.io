# My Works
Here are some of my works as a music producer:

## Fusion Of Love OST
[**Fusion Of Love**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRORSil5bcg&t=0s) was an Animation Project for a group students that made this project in order to get a degree on Digital Animation, and that i had the honour to work on.
I only was asked to do the musicalization of the scenes, and everything else related to audio such as Voices, Sound Effects and the actual volume mixing of the final Animation was not done by me.

## Cosmic Reach Fan Soundtrack
[**Cosmic Reach**](https://finalforeach.itch.io/cosmic-reach) is a Minecraft clone Videogame with Space and Science Fiction themes, and through this songs i've tried to capture those themes in a way so the music fits Cosmic Reach's tone and themes with ambient soundscapes crafted between a mix of Synthetic and Analog sounds.
